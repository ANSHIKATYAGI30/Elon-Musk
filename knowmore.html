       Introduction 
    </h2>
<div class= "text4">
    We are already aware that "Elon Musk" is the richest man in the world with Jeff Bezos as the 2nd richest man.
    People wonder how Elon is so smart ?
    According to him, "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change." From all of Musk's ventures (Paypal,
    Tesla and SpaceX etc), we can see that flexibility and passion are two key drivers for his success, not intelligence.

       Childhood & Family
    </h2>
<div class= "text5">
    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.
    The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, 
    "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".After his parents divorced in 1980, 
    Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.
    Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... 
    Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done." He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.

      Views On Artificial intelligence, metaverse, and public transit
    </h2>
<div class= "text6">
    Musk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence (AI), repeatedly calling it the greatest threat to humanity.
    Musk's opinions about AI have provoked controversy.
    Consequently, according to CNBC, Musk is "not always looked upon favorably" by the AI research community.
     Musk and Zuckerberg have clashed on the issue, with Zuckerberg calling his warnings "pretty irresponsible".
     Musk's claims that humans live in a computer simulation have also been criticized.
    In December 2021, when prompted for his opinion about the virtual reality (VR) driven metaverse, 
    Musk said that he was "unable to see a compelling metaverse situation" and further remarked
    that "I think we're far from disappearing into the metaverse. This sounds just kind of buzzword-y.

    <h2>
      Views On Politics
    </h2>
<div class= "text7">
    In a 2015 interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a "significant (though not top-tier) donor
     to Democrats," but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. Musk further stated that political contributions
     are a requirement to have a voice in the United States government.[260] Musk has criticized Donald Trump for 
     his stance on climate change[261] and after joining Trump's two business advisory councils,
     Musk resigned from both in June 2017 in protest against Trump's decision to withdraw the United States
     from the Paris Agreement.
     In an interview with Christian conservative satirical website The Babylon Bee in December 2021, after selling 
     "enough stock" to reach his goal of selling 10% of his shares in Tesla (then the world's most valuable car company) 
     and relocating his personal and Tesla's tax residence from California to Texas in order to avoid state income tax,
      he lamented that it was "increasingly difficult to get things done" in California. In his own remarks, Musk said 
      that "California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is... becoming moreso the land of sort of overregulation, 
      overlitigation, overtaxation."
     In the same interview, he stated, "At its heart wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful. It basically gives mean people...
      a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false virtue."
