      Zip2
    </h2>
<div class= "info1">
    In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.
    They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.
     The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps,
     directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford 
     an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one
     computer with his brother.

      Sec lawsuit
    </h2>
<div class= "info2">
    In September 2018, Musk was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a tweet claiming 
    funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.The lawsuit claimed that discussions Musk 
    held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms and thus characterized the tweet 
    +as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly
     traded companies.Musk called the allegations unjustified and claimed he had never compromised his integrity.
    Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, 
    Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman
     but was able to remain as CEO.

    SolarCity and Tesla Energy
    </h2>
<div class= "info3">
    Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter
     Rive co-founded in 2006.By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the
      United States.In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in 
      Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.Construction on the 
      factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until 
      early 2020 when Panasonic departed.

        Managerial style and treatment of employees
    </h2>
<div class= "info4">
    Musk's managerial style and treatment of his employees have been heavily criticized.
    One person who worked closely with Musk said he exhibits "a high level of degenerate 
    behavior" such as paranoia and bullying.[166] Another described him as exhibiting"
    total and complete pathological sociopathy".[166] Business Insider reported that 
    Tesla employees were told not to walk past Musk's desk because of his "wild firing rampages".
    The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as "self-driving",
    he faced criticism from his engineers, some of whom resigned in response, with one stating that 
    Musk's "reckless decision making... had potentially put customer lives at risk".

    <h2>
      Hyperloop
    </h2>
<div class= "info5">
    In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain (or vacuum tube train), 
    assigning a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX to establish the conceptual foundations
     and create initial designs.On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop. 
    The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.
    The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system 
    could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area at an estimated total
     cost of $6 billion.The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop
      travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.

        Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case
    </h2>
<div class= "info6">
    In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a small rescue pod to assist the rescue of 
    children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue
     diving team, urged Musk on in construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.
     Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen
      transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand. By this time, however, eight of the 12 
      children had already been rescued using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia; consequently Thai 
      authorities declined to use the submarine.Elon Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various
       honors conferred by the King of Thailand in March 2019 for involvement in the rescue effort, 
       e.g. the Order of the Direkgunabhorn.

    Music Ventures
    </h2>
<div class= "info7">
    On March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap track, "RIP Harambe", on SoundCloud as Emo G Records. 
    The track, which is an allusion to the killing of Harambe, a gorilla in a Cincinnati zoo, 
    and the subsequent "tasteless" Internet sensationalism surrounding the event, was performed
     by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.
    On January 30, 2020, Musk released an EDM track, "Don't Doubt Ur Vibe", featuring his
    own lyrics and vocals.[225] While The Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it
    as "indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica
    posted elsewhere on Soundcloud",TechCrunch said it was "not a bad representation of the genre".

    <h2>
    Donations and Non-profits
    </h2>
<div class= "info8">
    Musk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which states its purpose is to provide solar-power energy 
    systems in disaster areas as well as to support research and development, advocacy, and educational goals.
    Since 2002, the foundation has made over 350 contributions. Around half were to scientific research or 
    education nonprofits. 
    Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, 
    and Kimbal's Big Green.Vox described the foundation as "almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet
     is strikingly opaque", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.
      The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.
      From 2002 to 2018, it gave out $25 million directly to non-profits, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,
       which was at the time a non-profit organization.[232] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, 
       because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.

    Musk is also a trustee of the X Prize Foundation.
     In January 2021, he promised to donate $100 million as a prize to whomever developed the best carbon capture technology.[
